### API Design Pattern
```
GET    /api/v1/leads              → list with filters/pagination
POST   /api/v1/leads              → create
GET    /api/v1/leads/{id}         → detail
PATCH  /api/v1/leads/{id}         → update
DELETE /api/v1/leads/{id}         → soft delete
POST   /api/v1/leads/{id}/convert → convert to contact
GET    /api/v1/leads/{id}/timeline→ activity timeline

All endpoints:
- Require Authorization: Bearer <token>
- Scope to org via middleware (X-Org-ID or JWT claim)
- Return: { data, meta: { total, page, per_page } }
- Errors: { error, message, details }
```

## 5. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase 1 — Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Goal: Working auth + org setup + basic lead management**
- [x] Project scaffold (FastAPI + React + PostgreSQL)
- [x] Auth: signup, login, JWT, refresh
- [x] Organisation create + onboarding flow
- [x] User invite + RBAC middleware
- [x] Basic contacts CRUD
- [x] Basic leads CRUD
- [x] Lead list + detail view
- [x] Simple dashboard skeleton
> **Status:** Backend auth/pipeline scaffolding, organisation onboarding, and basic CRM UI are running; frontend pages for login/signup/onboarding and the dashboard skeleton are wired to the FastAPI API routes.

### Phase 2 — CRM Core (Week 3-4)
**Goal: Full pipeline + tasks**
- [x] Pipeline kanban board (drag-and-drop)
- [x] Lead scoring
- [x] Activity timeline
- [x] Task management
- [x] Site visit scheduling
- [x] Notes + @mentions
- [x] Basic notifications
> **Status:** Pipeline, scoring, activity timeline, task management, and site visit scheduling are live with full Create/filters/status updates and slot-aware scheduling; notifications and notes are also in place.

### Phase 3 — Projects & Inventory (Week 5-6)
**Goal: Full inventory management**
- [x] Project CRUD + media upload (basic form + details UI)
- [x] Tower/Floor/Unit structure with tower snapshot and flat availability
- [x] Inventory grid view (status badges, filters, search)
- [x] Unit hold/book/sell flow (status changer in UI)
- [ ] Unit bulk upload (Excel)
- [ ] Price list generator
> **Status:** Project management, tower/flat CRUD, auto-generate flats, and the availability dashboard are live; bulk uploads and price-list exports remain for later.

### Phase 4 — Finance (Week 7-8)
**Goal: Quotation to payment**
- [ ] Cost sheet builder
- [ ] Quotation generator + PDF
- [ ] Invoice creation + PDF
- [ ] Payment recording + schedule
- [ ] Finance dashboard
- [ ] Overdue alerts
> **Status:** Finance module pending—quotations, invoices, and cost sheet flows are planned once backend APIs are available.

### Phase 5 — Integrations (Week 9-10)
**Goal: Portal connections + communication**
- [ ] Website lead form embed
- [ ] Facebook Lead Ads webhook
- [ ] 99acres / MagicBricks API (where available)
- [ ] Email integration (Gmail/Outlook)
- [ ] WhatsApp via WATI
- [ ] Portal performance dashboard
> **Status:** Phase 5 deferred per current roadmap; focus remains on CRM polish and finance before portal integrations.

### Phase 6 — Analytics & Polish (Week 11-12)
**Goal: Reports + enterprise readiness**
- [ ] Custom report builder
- [x] Advanced analytics charts
- [ ] Audit logs
- [ ] Bulk operations (import/export)
- [x] Mobile responsive polish
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Billing integration (Razorpay/Stripe)
> **Status:** Dashboard hero now includes analytics widgets, sparkline, pipeline distribution, and responsive spacing improvements; audit logs and billing still on the roadmap.

### Current Integration Snapshot
- **Authentication & Tenancy:** Email signup/login, organisation creation, RBAC checks, and multi-tenant-aware API routing are wired end-to-end (phase 1).  
- **Leads & Pipeline:** Kanban drag-drop, stage distribution, lead scoring, timeline, notes, aging modal, and basic notifications are available in the UI, backed by FastAPI endpoints (`pipeline/kanban`, `pipeline/leads/{id}/stage`, `dashboard/stats`).  
- **Projects & Inventory:** Project details page, tower picker, flat availability grid, auto-flat generator, and per-unit status editor are live; the API currently exposes tower/unit CRUD and status update routes.  
- **Dashboard & Analytics:** Owner dashboard renders stats, sparkline, stage bars, and pipeline pulse cards, plus spacing + hover polish for hero actions. Mobile responsiveness and UI improvements across dashboard/leads cards are delivered.  
- **Reporting & Audit:** Advanced analytics widgets (sparkline, stage bars) are live, but the custom report builder and audit log capture remain on the backlog.  
- **Finance & Billing:** Still pending—the cost sheet builder, quotations, invoices, payment schedules, and PDF exports await backend completion.  
- **Integrations & Automation:** Portal integrations, WhatsApp, email, and automated lead capture flows are postponed until core CRM/finance flows stabilize.

## 7. KEY DIFFERENTIATORS

1. **India-first**: INR, RERA compliance, Indian portal integrations, GST invoicing
2. **Inventory-aware CRM**: Unit-level tracking directly tied to leads — not just a generic CRM

4. **Finance depth**: Full demand note → invoice → collection cycle, not just basic invoicing
5. **Construction linked payments**: Milestone-based payment tracking tied to construction progress
6. **Site visit orchestration**: Full visit lifecycle from scheduling to outcome to follow-up
7. **WhatsApp-native**: WhatsApp is primary communication channel for Indian real estate
8. **Offline-capable PWA**: Agents on site can still access and update records
9. **No-code customization**: Custom fields, pipeline stages, templates without developer help
10. **Audit trail**: Full immutable log for compliance and dispute resolution
